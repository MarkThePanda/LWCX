LWC version 2.2.7.
Server Version 1.16.5, Purpur Build #1117.

When chests, doors, etc are not registered, players outside of a town, aka Outsiders, are able to claim stuff inside the towns.
For example, an outsider can /cprivate my chest inside my town even though they are not added to my town. This is an issue because
players inside the town are unable to interact or break the locked items.

Will LWC incorporate more towny integration? Is this a bug?
